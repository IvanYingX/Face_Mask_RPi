# Face_Mask_RPi
Deploy a face mask detection model into a RPi

If you are running the model on a Pi, make sure to install Tensorflow 2.4.0. Please, refer this repo to get the tf2 wheel https://github.com/lhelontra/tensorflow-on-arm/releases.

If you are not using a board, you can't temporarily comment out the gpiozero library
